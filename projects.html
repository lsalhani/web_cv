	<p>
		At school I build a sensored-triggered LED circuit. The aim of the circuit was to dispense a scale to measure the weight of your bag in order to prevent people from lifting too heavy bags. I made the circuit on a simulation software then tested it on breadboard. I then printed the cicuit on a PCB and soldererd all the parts. The sensor was working but it unfortunetly didn't work unless the person got very very very close to the box.

		<h2 id = "hyped">HYPED</h2>
		<p>HYPED is a student led organisation made up of around 200 student developing the concept of the hyperloop introduced by Elon Musk. Each year HYPED competes at the European Hyperloop Week (EHW) to show what we have been working on during the year. During the first year I worked in motor control and worked on connecting CAN over 2 beaglebone. During the second year I got to be the project manager of this team and the software for the levitation system was also under my responsability. Throughout that year I got to lead a team of 6 people to construct the software for the levlitation along with the motor control. The first project we worked on was making the code for a PID controller which would then be implemented in multiple places. </p>
