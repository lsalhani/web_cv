		<p> I am a third year Electronics and Electrical Engineering student with large experience in coding and hardware communication systems. Throughout the past years I have acquired experience in management though leading a team and communication and presentation skills though that same role and public communication classes. Always eager to learn more and expand my knowledge and apply the skills I acquired.

		<h2>Why I got into Electronic and Electrical Engineering</h2>
		<h5>click detail to show</h5>
	<section id="ps">
		<details close>
		<p>The book “How to be human in the age of the machine” mentions that “computer algorithms increasingly control and decide our future”. This idea struck me as it highlighted the dangers of technological progress. Ever since attending an enlightening lecture on AI and its expanding significance in the world, I understood that my preferred branch of Electrical Engineering would be the one that enabled me to further pursue my interest in understanding how to control machines.</p>
		<p>My IB Physics course opened my eyes to the world and the laws it follows, such as a fascinating class on electromagnetism and transformers; I was fascinated by the idea of having such an elaborate piece of equipment in such a simple charger. My curiosity led me to cut into a charger and explore the transformer inside; this helped me understand the mechanism of a transformer and comprehend the concept that transforms voltage. During my IB, I conducted many investigations to explore various fields of engineering which led me specifically to the field of electrical engineering. In my math class, I conducted an investigation of aerodynamics as I looked at modelling an airplane wing and using a function for the wing, looked at the lift generated depending on thickness. This gave me the opportunity to go beyond my mathematics syllabus and explore the application of math to fields like engineering. Recently, I conducted an investigation on the electronic charge to mass ratio. This experiment was fascinating as it allowed me to explore the effect of magnetic and electric fields on a beam of electrons in order to control its direction. Additionally, my IGCSE Design and Technology class allowed me to complete a project solving back problems caused by heavy backpacks. During this project I was able to learn, develop and apply problem-solving skills; for instance in my project, I had a problem with my circuit which worked on breadboard but not on the final PCB. Completing the project also offered me various tools and techniques such as using CAD primarily to design something or soldering, giving me an insight into the world of engineering.</p>
		<p>In school I got a first sense of programming with block-based code using scratch but I was always intrigued by ‘real’ programming. This wonder for ‘real’ programming guided me to take part in a specialization course offered by the University of Michigan, entitled: “Programming for Everybody Getting Started with Python''. Python really stood out to me due to its logic; I find that following a precise algorithm is thrilling as it allows the understanding of how we are able to communicate with machines we use everyday. Algorithms are the basis of computing, using solely algorithms, people are able to make anything from calculators to virtual assistants, like Google home. In addition, this course led me to perceive the power of a simple if/ifelse statement to be truly magnificent. These simple statement-examining conditions offer such an enormous potential. I used this knowledge to explore the field of business by taking a course in portfolio construction and analysis with Python.</p>
		<p>Reading the book “Surely you’re joking Mr.Feynman!” expanded my interest further, as I could identify many similarities between Feynman’s curious personality as a child and my own. I also enjoy reading magazines like the MagPi. During the Michigan course on the basis of Python, I listened to an interview with Eben Upton, one of the founders of raspberry pi which gave me an insight into the process of creating raspberry pi. This stimulated my interest and as I was searching for a way to apply my Python knowledge, I acquired a raspberry pi 3 and I decided to build a robot buggy and program it giving simple commands in Python. </p>
		<p> Creating things that have intelligence and are able to respond to commands is why I chose to study electrical engineering. I really look forward to exploring electrical engineering and learning more about the world around us.</p>

	<h2>Table of location since end 2021</h2>
	<h4>One of the thing I love most is to travel. Even when I am at uni I try and visit my friends from back home which study all around the world. This allows me to discover the life in different countries along with the culture. During the summer I always tray and visit new place. Being French but never living there I try and explore different parts of France and discover the country. The table mention the contry visited <mark>outside Luxembourg</mark>. I now study in Edinburgh hence the amount of times it apears on this list.
		<br>(Luxembourg will be put if no country visited during that month) </h4>
